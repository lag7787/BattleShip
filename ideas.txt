Random ship placement:
    iterate through each ship
    randomly decide how its oriented

    How should I implement the ship placement? should I 
    1. generate a data strucutre containing all possibe placements? 
        trade-offs: runtime complexity O(n^2) where n is the size of a row/column 
        this would put is to n^3 runtime, which is not ideal

    2. geneate random spots and potentially check for collisions?
        best case its constant time. a much better solution than out previous 
        how should I check for collision with other ships? 
        make a meory trade off: store the positions of past ships in a data strucutre?
